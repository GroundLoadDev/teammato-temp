# Teammato - Anonymous Feedback Platform

### Overview
Teammato is an enterprise-grade, Slack-first SaaS platform for anonymous feedback within organizations. It ensures privacy through k-anonymity, per-organization encryption, and multi-tenant isolation. The platform aims to foster transparent feedback, boost employee engagement, and deliver actionable insights while protecting user anonymity. Key features include time-boxed feedback campaigns, robust moderation, privacy-preserving analytics, and seamless Slack integration. The project includes a marketing website rebuild with interactive elements, a multi-phase Admin Dashboard redesign (billing, compliance, system health, audience config), and a CPU-based ML pipeline for automatic theme generation from feedback.

### User Preferences
I prefer iterative development and clear, concise explanations. Ask before making major changes to the architecture or core functionalities. Ensure all new features align with the privacy-first principle.

### System Architecture

#### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for a modern administrative interface and responsive public pages. Admin dashboards offer real-time statistics, topic and feedback management, and user/billing settings. Design principles include consistent emerald-600 accents, rounded cards, responsive grids, and accessibility.

#### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Express.js with PostgreSQL (Neon) via Drizzle ORM.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Session-based authentication, Slack OAuth v2, and role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Moderator, Viewer) with Row-Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenancy.
- **Privacy Architecture**: K-anonymity (k=5), application-layer encryption (XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD with per-org DEKs), pseudonymity, PII/`@mention` filtering, and daily-rotating submitter hashes.
- **Slack Integration**: Slack OAuth v2, Slash Commands, and Events API for feedback submission (modals), daily digests, and invitations.
- **Moderation Workflow**: Flag queue, bulk actions, and immutable audit trails for moderation.
- **Topic Management**: Time-boxed feedback campaigns, auto-lock cron jobs, "You said / We did" loops, and user-suggested topics. Anti-gamification safeguards prevent topic creators from submitting feedback to their own topics and enforce one submission per user per topic.
- **Analytics & Export**: Privacy-preserving aggregated metrics with k-safe export capabilities using database views (`v_threads`, `v_comments`) that enforce k-anonymity thresholds.
- **User Management**: Slack-native invitation system, role management, and user removal.
- **Security**: Session regeneration, CSRF protection, and robust org-scoping.
- **Theming System**: CPU-based ML pipeline for local processing of feedback embeddings (@xenova/transformers on ONNX runtime) using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, c-TF-IDF keywording, and template-based summarization.
- **Billing & Subscription**: Comprehensive Stripe integration with 7 pricing tiers, monthly/annual options, seat-based capacity management, contextual banners, invoice history, and deep integration with Stripe Checkout and Customer Portal. An 8-state billing state machine (installed_no_checkout, trialing, active, trial_expired_unpaid, past_due, over_cap_grace, over_cap_blocked, canceled) with persistence is implemented.
- **Seat-Cap Notifications**: Automated Slack DM and email notifications for owner/admin users at capacity thresholds (â‰¥90%, >100%, >110% or grace expiry).

#### System Design Choices
- **Multi-tenancy**: Achieved through RLS using `current_org_id()` and per-org encryption.
- **Event-Driven**: Centralized Slack Events API integration.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Cron jobs for topic lifecycle, new feedback instances, and reminders.
- **Database Schema**: Designed for privacy and scalability, including tables for `orgs`, `users`, `topics`, `threads`, `items`, `comments`, `slack_teams`, `moderation_audit`, `slack_settings`, `topic_suggestions`, `org_keys`, `post_embeddings`, `themes`, and `theme_posts`.
