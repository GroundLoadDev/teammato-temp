PROMPT — Rebuild Section 2 (Aggregate Summary Poster)

Objective: Replace the current Section 2 with a single, premium “poster” component that proves what leaders get—an anonymized theme summary with one clear action. It must read as marketing, not an admin panel. Use existing theme tokens only.

Section framing (text to ship)

H2: Themes at a glance.

Subhead (one line): When enough teammates weigh in, Teammato delivers a single, anonymized summary you can act on.

The poster card (one card, centered)

Max width: 920px.

Padding: pt-40 pb-36.

Spacing from previous section: mt-112 (no negative margins).

Shadow: long/soft (16–20px blur, low opacity). Parent must allow overflow.

Header (seafoam strip, 56–64px tall)

Left, bold label: Aggregate summary

Under it (muted, same line): Topic · Roadmap clarity

Right: cohort dots — fixed 6–8 small circles in seafoam tones (decorative only; never wrap).

Teal L-frame outline (1px) on the top and left edges of the card only.

Body

Muted intro label: Anonymized themes

Three one-line theme chips (no paragraphs):

Clarify scope before demos

Share sprint goals earlier

Add QA sign-off checklist

Action bar (at bottom)

Chip: You said → We did

One concise action sentence: Added QA sign-off to Friday release checklist

Micro-note (optional, tiny, footer-right): Individual comments are never shown

Brand form factor

No window chrome, kebab menus, timestamps, dividers, or extra badges.

Quad-corner lift: simulate a lifted top-left corner with a corner-biased shadow; do not change border radius.

Seafoam used once (header strip).

Tomato micro-accent: exactly one 4–6px dot inside the action icon; nowhere else in this section.

Motion (meaningful only)

Cohort dots stagger in (80ms) when card enters view.

Action chip slides in 4–6px after the dots.

No zooms. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Accessibility & contrast

Deep-teal text on the seafoam header for AA+.

Visible teal focus ring on any interactive chip/link.

Theme chips are one line each; truncate with ellipsis if needed.

Acceptance checklist (must pass)

Section contains only: H2, subhead, one centered poster card, micro-note (optional).

Card looks like a final deliverable, not a dashboard.

Exactly three theme chips + one action sentence.

Dots never wrap; L-frame aligns perfectly; shadow not clipped.

Generous white space above/below; no background quads in this section.

No words like “example,” “k-met,” or internal jargon.

If a placeholder is required (no live UI yet)

Use a neutral image box labeled PLACEHOLDER: AGGREGATE_SUMMARY_CARD that follows the structure above (header strip, dots row, three chips, action chip). Do not attempt to auto-draw extra UI.
