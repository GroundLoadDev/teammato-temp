Teammato Launch Readiness Checklist
1) Product Objectives → Shippable Outcomes

 Slack-first install is the primary CTA; web is admin/analytics.

 Anonymous posting & k-anonymity are enforced across threads/comments, analytics, exports.

 Weekly digests run reliably (cron + “Send Sample Now”).

 Self-serve pricing: 14-day trial → paywall; Pro $99/mo or $999/yr; Scale bands auto-enforced by seat caps.

 Low-touch ops: email support only, no SLAs, no on-prem.

2) Environments & Secrets (Test ↔ Live)

 APP_ENV and VITE_PUBLIC_APP_ENV aligned (test/live banners visible).

 Slack (client ID/secret/signing secret/redirect) configured for both apps (Test & Live).

 Stripe keys & webhook secrets set for test/live; live webhook endpoint verified.

 No secrets leak to client bundle (checked).

3) Slack Install, Commands, Events

 OAuth flow completes → creates/maps org + Slack team; redirects to /post-install with welcome message.

 Slash command verifies HMAC; acks <2s; never logs plaintext.

 Events: url_verification handled; on app_uninstalled → redact token, disable digests, audit log.

 Post-install UI: choose channel, “send sample,” show /teammato help|about.

4) Billing, Pricing, Trial, Seat Caps

 Stripe prices exist for Pro (monthly/annual) and Scale bands (500/1k/2.5k/5k; monthly/annual).

 Checkout/Portal endpoints working; webhook updates plan_tier, seat_cap, term in orgs.settings.

 Trial logic: 14-day timer; D12 & D14 nudges (Slack DM + email); read-only on expiry until upgrade.

 Automated seat counting from Slack; store member_count; warn at 90%, grace to 110% for 7 days, then block new posts.

 Admin Billing UI shows plan, term, usage meter, trial chip, over-cap/read-only banners.

5) Data Model, RLS, and Security

 Core tables present (orgs, users, threads, comments, reactions, Slack tables, analytics, moderation).

 End-to-end encryption-at-rest for content (ciphertext + nonce); no plaintext logs.

 RLS isolates by org_id; secure views (v_threads, v_comments, etc.) enforce k-anonymity.

 Structured logging via shared logger with redaction; no PII or tokens in logs.

6) Admin & Analytics

 /admin/* guarded by JWT org_id & role; session refresh after org changes/OAuth.

 Analytics dashboard renders with k-anonymity gating; daily aggregates job healthy.

 Export admin returns signed URL (no ciphertext fields).

7) Retention, Legal, Deletion, Export

 Retention controls visible; retention_purge_cron respects legal_hold.

 Two-step org deletion flow works; cascades Slack rows → content → users → org.

 Trust/Privacy/Terms pages live; sitemap/robots good.

8) Marketing Site & Pricing Page

 Pages: /, /pricing, /faq, /contact, /privacy, /trust, /terms complete with SEO meta.

 Pricing page shows single product; feature parity; seat-cap bands; annual toggle “Save 2 months.”

9) Operational Runbooks

 Health check endpoint returns OK with Slack/Stripe checks.

 On-call basics: how to rotate keys, redeploy functions, view logs, pause digests.

 Support: email-only policy documented; escalation limited to outages.

10) Manual QA (Happy Paths + Edge Cases)

 Install flow (Test): Add to Slack → /slack/oauth → /post-install → welcome message appears.

 Slash command: /teammato help|about, create thread; no plaintext in logs.

 Digest: “Send Sample Now” works; scheduled weekly digest posts.

 Uninstall: App removed → tokens redacted; digests disabled; audit written.

 Billing: Trial start/expiry, monthly & annual checkout; webhook sets plan & cap; over-cap grace then block.

 Exports & retention: Export excludes ciphertext; purge respects retention_days/legal_hold.

 Env labeling: Test banner in test; none in live; wrong redirect URIs rejected.

11) Live Cutover Plan

 Duplicate Slack app to Live; set live redirect/command/events URLs; verify OAuth.

 Flip APP_ENV + public env to live; rebuild frontend; deploy Edge; confirm banners & IDs.

 Create live Stripe prices (if not already); point webhooks to live endpoint; test $0 test card in live disabled.

 Smoke test: install, post, digest, upgrade, uninstall (Live).

12) Risk, Rollback, and Guardrails

 Rollback notes for each function (previous deploy IDs, how to revert).

 Feature flags for trial enforcement & over-cap block (quick disable path).

 Stripe webhook idempotency verified; dead-letter strategy for failures.

13) Assets & Content

 Slack App Directory manifest + brand assets; /.well-known/slack/manifest.json routable.

 In-product help copy (slash help, welcome message, trust explainer) finalized.

 Pricing copy: simple/self-serve, identical features, seat caps vary, email support only.

14) Ownership & Contacts

 Owner/Admin bootstrap path documented (SQL or /no-org bootstrap).

 Support & Security emails routed and monitored.
