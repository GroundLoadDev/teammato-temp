Trust & Security (Preview)

Goal
Signal “enterprise-grade + privacy-first” in one glance, and route serious buyers to /trust for the deep dive.

Framing (ship this)

H2: Trust & security

Subhead (one line): Privacy is enforced in the product—and verified by audits.

Layout (two stacked blocks, compact)
Block A — Audit & compliance strip

Format: one neutral rail with 4 inline pills (icon + short label).

Pills (exact text):

SOC 2 audited annually

Regular pen testing

24/7 monitoring

GDPR/CCPA-ready controls

Right-aligned link: Read the details → (to /trust#security)

Visual rules

Rail: --card bg, --border stroke, soft shadow, rounded corners.

Pills default = outline; hover = seafoam tint; teal focus ring on keyboard focus.

Icons: deep-teal, stroke ≈ 1.75.

No seafoam fills for the rail; just on pill hover.

Spacing

Top offset from Feature Grid: var(--space-L) = 72px

Rail padding: 16–20px vertical, 20–24px horizontal.

Behavior

Desktop/tablet: pills wrap (no scrollbar).

Mobile: pills horizontal snap with hidden scrollbar.

Placeholders

PLACEHOLDER: ICON_SOC2

PLACEHOLDER: ICON_PENTEST

PLACEHOLDER: ICON_MONITORING

PLACEHOLDER: ICON_GDPR

Block B — How privacy is enforced (mini diagram)

Format: a single compact diagram card (max width 920px) that illustrates the release logic.

Title (inside card, small): How privacy is enforced

Diagram (left→right flow):

Topic instance (W##) → Submissions (multiple small quads) → Threshold gate (lock + meter) → Aggregate summary

Caption (muted, under the diagram): Themes release in aggregate once the minimum threshold is met.

Visual rules

Card: neutral background, subtle border, faint quad watermark in one corner (4–5% opacity).

Use the seafoam only on the threshold gate (lock + meter) to signal the privacy moment.

One tomato micro-accent allowed inside the lock icon or skip entirely if noisy.

Placeholders

PLACEHOLDER: DIAGRAM_TOPIC_TO_SUMMARY (simple boxes/arrows—not detailed UI)

Spacing

Gap between Block A and B: var(--space-M) = 48px

Card padding: 24px; diagram area ~240–280px tall (desktop).

Motion (subtle, meaningful)

In the diagram, animate the small quads filling the meter (80ms stagger) then reveal the “Aggregate summary” box.

Pills: light fade/translate-y 1px on hover (no scale).

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Accessibility

AA contrast for text on neutral and on seafoam hover.

Pills and the “Read the details →” link have visible teal focus rings.

Diagram has aria-label="How privacy is enforced"; caption is plain text under it.

Acceptance checklist (must pass)

Section shows H2 + subhead + one audit rail + one mini diagram card—nothing else.

No desktop scrollbars; pills wrap on smaller widths; mobile uses horizontal snap.

Seafoam appears only on pill hover and the threshold gate in the diagram.

Icons consistent (stroke ≈ 1.75); focus rings visible.

Diagram reads in 3 seconds: Topic → Submissions → Gate → Summary.

If tomato appears, it’s a single tiny dot inside the lock; otherwise omit.
