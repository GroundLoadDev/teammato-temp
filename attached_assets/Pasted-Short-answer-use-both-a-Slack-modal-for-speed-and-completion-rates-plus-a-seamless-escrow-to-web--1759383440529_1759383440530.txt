Short answer: use both—a Slack modal for speed and completion rates, plus a seamless “escrow to web” handoff when the user needs richer validation or longer inputs.

Here’s how I’d decide and implement.

Recommendation

Default to a Slack modal (Block Kit) for 80–90% of submissions. It reduces friction (no context switch), boosts completion, and fits simple SBI well.

Offer an “Open advanced form” link inside the modal (and as a validation fallback) that deep-links to a secure web form when:

the text trips stricter checks (e.g., @handles, names/PII, toxic language, exact dates that increase re-ID risk),

the user needs richer features (attachments, multiple examples, preview, drafts, long text),

or they’re doing a special flow (e.g., opt-in 360, compliance report).

Why this split works (product + science)

Lower activation energy → more voice. Staying in Slack minimizes perceived cost of speaking up—key when fear of retaliation is high.

Guardrails kick in only when needed. The handoff preserves anonymity while letting you run heavier redaction/triangulation checks that modals can’t do well.

Structured prompts in-context. The modal keeps SBI coaching right where people already are, improving specificity without making the task feel “official.”

What each option does best
Criterion	Slack modal (native)	Web form (advanced)
Friction / completion	Excellent (no context switch)	Lower (new tab)
SBI structure	Good (3 inputs, hints)	Excellent (rich tips, examples, dynamic help)
Validation	Basic (required, length, simple regex client-side; server can reject on submit)	Advanced (PII/name detection, toxicity, k-risk scoring, live feedback, previews)
Attachments	Weak (no file input in modals; requires separate upload flow)	Strong (files, screenshots, scrub EXIF)
Length & layout	Constrained (block limits, narrow UI)	Flexible (long text, collapsible sections)
Multi-step flows	Okay (view pushing)	Excellent (wizards, branching)
Accessibility	Good (Slack a11y)	You control a11y; can be great
Security posture	Slack auth context	Your SSO, risk controls, audit, rate limiting
Drafts & autosave	No	Yes
Concrete design

Slack modal fields (simple SBI)

Topic picker (static or external select with typeahead).

Situation (short text; date/time optional).

Behavior (multiline; required; 200–800 chars recommended).

Impact (multiline; required; 100–500 chars recommended).

Optional: “Suggest a topic” toggle (hidden if launched from a topic).

Inline tips: 1-line examples under each field.

Lightweight checks in the modal (client-ish)

Prevent @ and obvious names (fail with a helpful message).

Character minimums to curb vague feedback.

If fail → show:
“This needs extra protection/cleanup. Continue in the secure form?” [Open advanced form]

Advanced web form extras

Real-time PII/name/@handle redaction suggestions.

Toxicity + doxxing screens with rewrite suggestions.

k-risk hints (e.g., “Avoid unique dates/titles that could identify you or others.”)

Attachments with metadata scrubbing.

Drafts, preview, and “send test to me” receipt.

360/HR/compliance variants (different routing, stricter rules).

Handoff mechanics (secure and smooth)

When user clicks “Open advanced form” or validation rejects:

Your app generates a short-lived, single-use token bound to Slack user ID (not stored long-term) + topic + tenant, and signs it.

Open a browser with form.example.com/new?token=….

The web app exchanges token for a pseudonymous session (no real user data), pre-fills any modal inputs, and continues.

On submit, return a receipt hash and optionally DM the user a confirmation (“Submitted to Leadership comms; you remain anonymous.”).

Admin & privacy guardrails (same for both)

Enforce release only when k-threshold is met; otherwise queue in encrypted storage.

Coarsen timestamps and suppress cohorts unless cohort ≥ k.

Block person-targeted feedback except in opt-in, time-boxed 360 cycles with k≥3–5 and only aggregated outputs.

Implementation notes (nuts & bolts)

Slack: views.open → modal; views.update for inline errors; views.push if you need a confirm screen. Use external_select for topic typeahead. Do server-side validation on view_submission and respond with response_action: "errors" to keep the user in-modal when possible.

Web: SSO (if available) but always issue a pseudonymous submitter ID to preserve anonymity; store any real identity only in ephemeral handoff state (<10 mins). Add CSRF, rate limiting, and bot detection.

Files: If you must accept files from Slack, support a post-submission DM that says “Reply with a file to attach to your anonymous feedback” and proxy-upload it server-side; otherwise prefer web form for attachments.

Default config I’d ship

Start with the Slack modal as the primary entry, always visible in App Home and via /feedback.

Include an “Advanced form” link and auto-handoff when checks fail.

Use the same copy and SBI coaching in both places, with richer examples on the web.

Log strictly minimal metadata in both paths; delete raw text after aggregation window if policy allows.
