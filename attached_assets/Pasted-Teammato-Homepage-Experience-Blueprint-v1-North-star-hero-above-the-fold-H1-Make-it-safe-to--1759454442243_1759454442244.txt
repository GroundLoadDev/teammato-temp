Teammato Homepage — Experience Blueprint (v1)
North-star hero (above the fold)

H1: Make it safe to speak up—right in Slack.
Subhead (≤140 chars): Anonymous by default with behavior-focused prompts and aggregate summaries your leaders can act on.
CTAs: Primary “Add to Slack” • Secondary “See how it works”
Proof chips (3): Anonymous by default • Aggregate summaries (not names) • Install in minutes

Design moves

Quad Field: large, sparse, 6–7% opacity; one quad peeks off-edge.

Hero proof card (right): modal crop with aggregation meter (4 quads fill sequentially on load), teal L-frame outline, long soft shadow, micro tomato bead on the modal (one red dot only).

Press physics on primary button; teal focus ring visible.

Acceptance

H1 left-aligned; hero card overlaps section boundary by ~24–32px.

Page passes squint test: one bold object (hero card), not a sea of cards.

Section 1 — “Install moments” strip (90 seconds to value)

A tight 3-panel strip showing the whole journey, no paragraphs:

Install (OAuth screenshot) → label “Connect in seconds”

Capture (SBI modal crop) → label “Behavior & Impact (Situation optional)”

Publish (You said → We did card) → label “Share actions—without exposing anyone”

Design moves

Bento asymmetry: 45% / 27.5% / 27.5%.

Each tile uses a distinct shape cue: seafoam side rail, header strip, corner lift.

Acceptance

No lorem; each label ≤40 chars.

Quad Field only behind the center tile (very faint).

Section 2 — Signature component: Aggregate Summary

This is the poster child. One wide card with:

Seafoam header strip + cohort dots (8–10, fixed width, 2–3 seafoam tones)

“Released Week W##” chip (k-safe batching hint)

2–3 theme bullets + a small “You said → We did” chip

Subtle inner shadow in body; teal L-frame (top/left edges only)

Acceptance

One container, one border; no header/body seam.

Shadow not clipped; dots never wrap; icon stroke = 1.75.

Section 3 — Why it’s safe (security fact strip)

A single neutral rail with three inline pills (icon + verb-led fact):

Encrypt per org (AEAD)

Don’t log IPs in feedback tables

Isolate by tenant (RLS)
Add “Learn more →” linking to /trust#security.

Acceptance

Pills, not cards.

Seafoam underline on hover; teal focus rings.

Section 4 — Why it’s useful (science + behavior)

Two columns: left = short bullets, right = mini visual.

Bullets (benefit-led)

Clearer input: Light SBI prompts keep it behavior-focused.

Higher participation: In-Slack capture, no portal friction.

Faster fixes: Aggregate themes feed “You said → We did.”

Visual

Little SBI microcard with our final placeholders; one inline rule hint bubble (“Remove names/@—describe the behavior”).

Acceptance

No heavy copy; 3 bullets only; one micro-visual.

Section 5 — For HR / Managers / Security (role tabs)

Tabs (3) with persona-specific value and one module each:

HR: “Drive retention & engagement” + Aggregate Summary example + link to /faq#hr.

Managers: “Fewer surprises, faster fixes” + Action Post example.

Security: “Privacy-first by design” + Security Fact Bar condensed + link to /trust.

Design moves

Active tab uses seafoam underline and small quad icon; tab panels vary layout slightly so the page doesn’t feel templated.

Acceptance

Each tab <150 words; one screenshot per tab; visible focus ring on tabs.

Section 6 — How it works (4-step)

Row of 4 compact cards:

Open in Slack

Write Behavior & Impact

We aggregate when there’s enough input

Publish actions

Design moves

Steps use the quad-corner form factor for #3 only (aggregation cue).

Replace checklists with verb-first titles; one line of support text only.

Acceptance

Uniform height; hover = subtle shadow lift only; no zooms.

Section 7 — Anonymity Promise (brand banner)

Full-width seafoam ribbon with quad stamp (embossed). One sentence:

We show themes, not people. Individual comments remain hidden until there’s enough input.

Acceptance

Single sentence; readable on non-Retina; one quad watermark inside the pill.

Section 8 — Feature grid (compact, scannable)

6 tiles, two rows (3 + 3), not long paragraphs. Each tile = icon + 2 lines:

Slack-native modal

Anonymous by default

Aggregate summaries

Topic workflows (including General feedback rolling instance)

Admin review & action posts

Data controls (retention, export, legal hold)

Design moves

Icons are line + soft fill; micro tomato dot appears in exactly one tile (Action posts icon), nowhere else in the section.

Acceptance

Tiles 160–200px high; consistent strokes; equal gutter spacing.

Section 9 — Trust preview (link out)

Two stacked elements:

Audit & compliance strip: SOC 2 / pen tests / 24×7 monitoring badges (text-only pills).

Mini diagram: Parent topic → time-boxed instances (W41/W42) → release gate (k met) → Aggregate Summary. No numbers, just shapes.

Acceptance

Diagram uses quads + arrows; no body copy beyond labels.

Section 10 — Social proof (swap when you have it)

Either:

Logo bar (monochrome) or

2 short outcomes in “Signals we shipped” format: date + one-line result.

Acceptance

Keep monochrome; no moving carousels.

Section 11 — Pricing CTA (light)

Neutral card with single line:
“Start free • Add to Slack in minutes • No credit card.”
Button: “Add to Slack” (primary) + “Pricing” (ghost).

Acceptance

Short; no feature matrix here.
