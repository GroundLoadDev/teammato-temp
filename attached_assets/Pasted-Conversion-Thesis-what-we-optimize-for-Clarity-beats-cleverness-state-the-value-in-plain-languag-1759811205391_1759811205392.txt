Conversion Thesis (what we optimize for)

Clarity beats cleverness: state the value in plain language, early and often. Skimmable copy wins.

Pricing pages must reduce effort & risk: obvious plan, obvious next step, and crisp FAQ near the call-to-action. 
CXL
+1

Microcopy that informs + influences + supports the action: explain “what happens next,” remove surprises (card-gated trial), and smooth the interaction. 
Nielsen Norman Group

Social proof where decisions happen: logos/testimonials near CTAs, not buried. 
Baymard Institute

Slack-native flow preserved: “Add to Slack” remains the front door; we gate usage right after OAuth, which aligns with Slack’s install expectations.

Card-gated trial disclosure: reduces day-14 drop-off, but demands transparent messaging; trade-offs are well-documented.

1) Homepage (Public)
Hero

Goal: clarity + expectation setting without killing momentum.

Headline (plain value):
“Anonymous feedback your team actually uses — right in Slack.”

Subhead (outcome-driven):
“Collect signals, protect anonymity with k-anonymity, and ship weekly digests that leaders act on.”

Primary CTA: Add to Slack
Helper line (microcopy): “Start free for 14 days — card added after install. You won’t be charged today.”
(Short, skimmable, and sets the next step; this balances clarity with conversion.) 
Nielsen Norman Group
+1

Why: Users skim. A clear headline + specific helper text outperforms cleverness, and the helper line handles the “card gate” expectation without scaring off motivated buyers. 
Nielsen Norman Group
+1

Secondary trust row (above the fold or just below)

Client logos or “built for Slack” style credibility markers.

One short testimonial (“We finally get candid feedback without dogpiles.” — Manager, 200-person org).
Place near the CTA, not at the footer. 
Baymard Institute
+1

“How it works” (4 steps, one line each)

Add to Slack

Start your 14-day trial (card required after install)

Post anonymously (Slack command)

Weekly digest & trends
(Use verbs, keep to one line; clarity + path-to-value.) 
Nielsen Norman Group

Social proof block (mid-page)

2–3 short quotes + lightweight metrics (“85% of teams ship their first digest within a week”). Put a mini-CTA under it: Add to Slack.

2) Pricing Page

High-level goals: fewer choices, scannable benefits, and the answers to billing questions right next to the CTA. 
CXL
+1

Plan cards (keep simple)

Pro — $99/mo (up to 250 Slack users)

Scale bands (500 / 1k / 2.5k / 5k / 10k / 25k) with clear prices.

Annual toggle shows “Save 2 months.”

Under each price:
“Free today. Renews $99/mo on {DATE} unless canceled.” (Dynamic date on app side.)
“Card added after install.” (One short sentence; don’t bury it.) 
Userpilot

Feature list (identical across paid, seat cap differs)

Anonymous posts & comments • Weekly digest • Moderation flags • Full analytics • Multi-channel • K-anonymity • Retention controls
(Consistency reduces paralysis; map one persona per plan cap.) 
eleken.co

FAQ (inline, not separate page)

Do I need a card to start? “Yes — after you connect Slack, you’ll add a card to begin your 14-day trial. You won’t be charged until {DATE}.”

Can I pay now? “Yes — choose ‘Charge today’ to start billing immediately.”

Can I cancel before billing? “Any time during the trial.”

What if we exceed our seat cap? “You’ll get a 7-day grace period with clear upgrade prompts.”
(Place FAQs directly beneath pricing to defuse anxiety and prevent pogo-sticking.) 
Userpilot

Social proof next to pricing

Add 1–2 logos or a single short testimonial near the CTA area—credible, not noisy. 
Baymard Institute

3) Post-Install (the Gate)

This page does the heavy lifting for conversion. Use microcopy that informs (what happens), influences (why act now), and supports (what exactly will be charged & when). 
Nielsen Norman Group

State A — No checkout yet

Header: “Start your 14-day free trial”

Line 1: “Free today. Renews $99/mo on {DATE} unless canceled.”

Primary button: Start trial

Secondary: Charge today (skip trial)

Footnote: “We’ll add your card now; you won’t be charged until {DATE}.”

State B — Trial active (card on file)

Banner: “Trial ends {DATE}. You’ll be billed $99/mo unless canceled.”

State C — Trial expired (no payment)

Banner: “Your trial ended {DATE}. Upgrade to resume posting.”

Button: Upgrade now

(Use a simple, single-purpose layout—one primary action per screen. Buyers should never wonder “what happens next.”) 
Nielsen Norman Group

4) FAQ (Public)

Place a trimmed FAQ on Pricing and a fuller version on the FAQ page.

How do we install? “Click Add to Slack; after install, you’ll start your 14-day trial.” 
Slack Developer Docs

Do we need a card? “Yes—added after install; no charge until {DATE}.”

Security & privacy? Short bullets with a link to Trust/Privacy. (Keep it concise—decision support.)

Will this clutter Slack? “No—anonymous posts are lightweight; weekly digests summarize activity.”

What counts toward seats? “Slack workspace members; we’ll warn at 90% and give a 7-day grace if you go over.”

(Concise answers reduce friction at the moment of truth; long walls of text depress conversion.) 
Userpilot

5) In-App Banners (Admin)

Before checkout (post-install): “Finish setting up your 14-day trial to unlock posting.” [Start trial]

During trial: “Trial ends {DATE}. You’ll be billed $99/mo unless canceled.” [Manage billing]

Seat cap 90%: “You’re nearing your 250-seat cap.” [See Scale plans]

Expired / Past due: “Your account is read-only until billing is resolved.” [Fix payment]

(Inform + support the action; do not hide billing language. This reduces surprises and improves trust.) 
Nielsen Norman Group

6) Slack-side Nudges (DMs)

D3 / D7 / D12: “Start (or finish) trial setup to keep posting. Free until {DATE}; billing begins after.”

Day 14 (if unpaid): “Your trial ended. Upgrade to resume posting.”

Seat cap: “You’ve reached 90% of your seat cap. Upgrade to avoid interruptions.”

(Minimal text, one link, one job. Clear microcopy supports the interaction and influences the next step.) 
Nielsen Norman Group

7) Visuals & layout guidance (quick wins)

Keep CTA within first viewport with helper text; avoid burying it after long hero copy. 
Perma Technologies

Use relevant, non-generic imagery (screens showing Slack command + digest), placed close to the explanatory text. 
Nielsen Norman Group

On pricing, prefer 2–3 cards and a tidy feature list; avoid complex tables unless necessary. 
CXL

Add lightweight trust markers near checkout prompts (card logos, secure payment note). Don’t overdo badges, but a small reassurance near a pricing decision helps. 
WiserNotify

Why this will convert better (in brief)

People skim; surfacing the exact next step and what happens with billing reduces hesitation and support escalations. 
Nielsen Norman Group

Pricing clarity, minimal plans, and FAQ near CTAs are repeatedly shown to raise completion on SaaS pages. 
CXL

Proximity of social proof to action (logos/testimonial near buttons) nudges commitment at the right moment. 
Baymard Institute

Keeping Add to Slack as the entry aligns with Slack’s install model and user expectations; gating usage post-install preserves marketplace flow.

Declaring the card gate succinctly (not loudly) meets disclosure best practice without tanking intent—buyers who proceed are better fits, a known effect of card-gated trials.
