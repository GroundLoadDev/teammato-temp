About Teammato — Page Outline & Copy
1) Slim hero (poster, no clutter)

Headline: We make it safe to tell the truth at work.
One-line: Anonymous feedback in Slack, released only in aggregate, so leaders see themes—not people.

Primary CTA: Add to Slack
Secondary CTA (muted): Read how anonymity works

Design: Centered poster card; seafoam signal strip only; one tomato micro-accent in the button icon.

2) What we’re here to solve (macro context)

Section title: Why Teammato exists
Copy (2–3 lines): Modern teams are distributed, overloaded, and cautious. People won’t speak if it risks targeting or performative listening. Teammato reduces risk (anonymous by default), makes input clearer (behavior → impact), and keeps it in-flow (Slack), so feedback turns into action—consistently.

Inline list (3 chips):

Anonymous capture in Slack

Clear, behavior-focused input

Actionable roll-ups, not one-offs

Design: Neutral rail with three chips. No badges, no big fills.

3) How it actually works (short + specific)

Section title: What happens under the hood
Three beats (1 line each):

Install in Slack and pick your channel.

Teammates submit via modal; we never log message plaintext in logs.

Results release only when a minimum cohort contributes (k-anonymity); leaders see aggregate themes and trends.

Micro CTA (text link): See the full loop

Design: Use your 4-step icons from the homepage; keep this version compact.

4) What we ship (the product, not promises)

Section title: What you get with Teammato
Six bullets (one line each):

Slack-native capture — open from App Home or /teammato.

Anonymous by default — views and exports respect k-anonymity.

SBI-guided clarity — Behavior & Impact required; fewer rants, more signal. (Design pattern we use across the site.)

Weekly digests — scheduled summaries in Slack; “Send Sample Now” for kickoffs.

K-safe analytics — daily aggregates; no plaintext message fields.

Retention & legal hold — purge by policy; freeze for compliance; export without ciphertext fields.

Design: Reuse your 2×3 Feature Grid tiles.

5) Privacy is enforced in the product (not just in policy)

Section title: How we protect people
Fact pills (4):

Encrypt per org (AEAD) at rest; TLS in transit.

Don’t log IPs/UA in feedback tables; never log plaintext message text.

Isolate by tenant (RLS) across all content.

Control retention & legal hold; export without ciphertext.

Tiny note (muted): We also auto-flag risky content (PII/harassment) before release.

Design: Use the security fact strip component; pills wrap on tablet, horizontal snap on mobile.

6) Built for low-touch ops (the model behind the product)

Section title: Simple to buy, simple to run
Copy (2 lines): Self-serve install, trial-first, and one product for everyone. We scale by seat bands—features stay the same, operations stay lean.

Quick facts (chips):

14-day full-feature trial; read-only after expiry until upgrade.

Pro at $99/mo or $999/yr; Scale bands for larger workspaces.

Email support; no custom SLAs or on-prem.

Design: Neutral rail with three chips and a “View pricing” text CTA.

7) CTAs (clean, centered)

Primary: Add to Slack
Secondary: View pricing · Read the Trust page

Design: Use your final conversion button style; keep plenty of air above and below.

Notes for your builder (so it feels on-brand)

Seafoam is a signal, not a fill. Use it for strips/rails/chips only.

One tomato micro-accent per viewport, max.

Keep spacing tokens: hero→next 72px, major breaks 112px.

No window chrome or fake screenshots on About—treat visuals like posters.

Respect reduced-motion; animate only meters/chips with 80–120ms staggers.
