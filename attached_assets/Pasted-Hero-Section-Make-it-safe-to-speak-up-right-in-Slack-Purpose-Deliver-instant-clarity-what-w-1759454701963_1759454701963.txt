Hero Section — “Make it safe to speak up—right in Slack.”
Purpose

Deliver instant clarity (what + where + why now), establish Teammato’s signature look, and create a tangible product proof above the fold.

Composition (desktop)

Layout grid

Two columns, 58/42 split.

Max width: 1180–1280px. Section padding: pt-24 / pb-16 (taller than average).

Left column (copy + CTAs)

H1 (editorial, left-aligned): “Make it safe to speak up—right in Slack.”

Subhead (1 sentence, ≤140 chars): “Anonymous by default with behavior-focused prompts and aggregate summaries your leaders can act on.”

Primary CTA: Add to Slack (primary)

Secondary CTA: See how it works (ghost)

Proof chips (3, in one row): Anonymous by default · Aggregate summaries (not names) · Install in minutes

Right column (product proof)

Hero card: cropped Slack modal (SBI fields) with:

Aggregation meter (4 quads) at the top; quads fill sequentially on load

Teal L-frame (1px outline on top/left edges) + long, soft shadow (12–18px blur, low opacity)

Overlap & lift: card intentionally overlaps the section boundary by ~24–32px into the next section

Tomato micro-accent: a single 4–6px dot as a notification bead on the card (one per viewport)

Background

Quad Field: large, sparse rounded-cross quads at 6–7% opacity; one quad sits partly off-canvas and peeks back in.

Subtle grain (1–2%) on the neutral background only (no grain on the card).

Visual language (brand tokens applied)

Primary: teal family; accent: seafoam only for signals, not fills

Typography: IBM Plex Serif for H1; Inter for subhead, chips, CTAs

Shadows: airy (long blur, low opacity). On hover, shadow changes only (no scale)

Focus rings: teal, visible on CTAs & chips (accessibility signal)

No yellow/brown anywhere

Motion & Interaction (meaningful, not decorative)

Meter reveal: the 4 meter-quads fill at 80ms stagger on initial load/in-view

Press physics: primary button depresses on click (translate-y 1px + shadow tighten)

Quad Field parallax: hero-only, ≤1% scroll parallax (respect prefers-reduced-motion)

CTA hover: subtle elevation; ghost CTA gains seafoam tint on hover (no gray wash)

Content variants (same layout; swap only text if needed)

Default (balanced): “Make it safe to speak up—right in Slack.”
Subhead: “Anonymous by default with behavior-focused prompts and aggregate summaries your leaders can act on.”

Outcome-led: “Find problems early. Fix them faster.”
Subhead: “Anonymous by default in Slack with behavior-focused input your leaders can act on.”

Security-led: “Privacy-first feedback, built for Slack.”
Subhead: “Anonymous capture, per-org encryption, tenant isolation—aggregate summaries only.”

(Keep one live; test the others later.)

Mobile & Tablet behavior

Tablet (≥768px)

Keep 58/42 split; reduce hero card overlap to ~16px

Shrink meter quads slightly; maintain L-frame

Mobile (<768px)

Order: product proof first, then H1, subhead, CTAs (shows product immediately)

H1 clamps at 2 lines; subhead trims to: “Anonymous by default. Built for action.”

Meter still animates; tomato bead remains visible

Proof chips collapse to a horizontal scroll (chip-rail)

Accessibility & Performance

H1 color contrast AA+ on your light background

Deep-teal text on any seafoam elements

Focus ring visible on both CTAs + chips

Hero card image is sized with explicit aspect ratio to prevent CLS

Parallax/motion respects prefers-reduced-motion

Do / Don’t (guardrails)

Do

Keep H1 left-aligned; use serif for H1 only

Ensure one element breaks the section edge (overlap & lift)

Use seafoam as signal (meter, chip underlines), not as big blocks

Don’t

Center the H1 on desktop

Add gradient blobs or Memphis art

Show numbers or “k-anonymity” jargon in the hero (explain below the fold)

Use tomato red as a background (micro-accent only)

Acceptance checklist (review in 30 seconds)

I see one signature object (the hero modal) overlapping the next section

The Quad Field is present but subtle; one quad peeks off-edge

The meter animates in a short stagger; CTAs feel tactile; focus rings are visible

Three proof chips say the promise without paragraphs

No yellow/brown; a single tomato micro-accent is used

Optional flourish (if you want a little “wow”)

Interactive quads: on hover near the hero card, nearby quads rotate 2–3° and brighten +5%—a soft pulse that implies “alive system,” not a static template.
