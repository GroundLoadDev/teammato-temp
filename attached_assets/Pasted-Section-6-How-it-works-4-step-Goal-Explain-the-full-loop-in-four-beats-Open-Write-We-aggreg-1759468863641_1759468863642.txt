Section 6 — How it works (4-step)

Goal
Explain the full loop in four beats—Open → Write → We aggregate → Publish—without walls of text. This section should feel like a clean, premium “process snapshot,” not a tutorial.

Framing (ship this)

H2: How it works

Subhead (1 line): Capture in Slack, release in aggregate, share actions—done.

Layout

Row of 4 compact cards, equal width.

Top offset from previous section: 72px (var(--space-L)).

Section padding: pt-24 pb-28.

Card padding: 20–24px; gap: 16–20px.

Card height target: 160–190px (desktop).

The 4 steps (titles + one-line)

Open in Slack
One line: “Launch the feedback modal from App Home or /teammato.”

Shape cue: Support Blue header strip (#E9F3FF).

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: STEP_OPEN_ICON

Write Behavior & Impact
One line: “Guided SBI prompts keep it specific and constructive.”

Shape cue: Seafoam side rail (6–8px) — privacy signal.

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: STEP_SBI_ICON

We aggregate when safe
One line: “Individual comments stay hidden until enough teammates weigh in.”

Shape cue: Quad-corner lift (shadow only; no radius change).

Visual: small aggregation meter (4 quads).

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: STEP_METER_ICON

Publish “You said → We did”
One line: “Share outcomes in Slack; build trust with visible follow-through.”

Shape cue: Lilac corner backplate (#F3EEFF) behind the icon only.

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: STEP_ACTION_ICON

Tomato micro-accent: tiny dot inside the action icon (this section only).

Visual rules

No full tint fills. Blue/Lilac/Seafoam appear on strips/rails/backplates only.

Icons: line + soft fill, consistent stroke (~1.75).

Focus rings: teal, visible on each card when navigated by keyboard.

No badges, timestamps, or extra chrome.

Motion (meaningful, subtle)

Cards reveal with 80ms stagger left→right.

Step 3’s meter fills (80ms per quad) on enter.

Hover = shadow lift only (no scale).

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Mobile & tablet

Tablet: 2×2 grid; keep shape cues.

Mobile: 1 column stacked; ensure titles stay one line (truncate if needed).

Maintain the tomato micro-accent on Step 4 only.

Spacing details

H2 → Subhead: 8–12px

Subhead → Card row: 16–20px

Card title → one-line: 8px

Accessibility

AA contrast on text over tints (deep blue/violet on Support tints, deep-teal on seafoam).

Each card is a focusable element (or contains a focusable “Learn more” link) with a visible teal focus ring.

Icon alt text or aria-label per step if icons are interactive.

Acceptance checklist

Section shows H2 + subhead + exactly 4 cards; equal widths on desktop.

Each card uses one shape cue max; Step 3 includes a meter; Step 4 has the only tomato dot.

No paragraphs; each step has one sentence.

Seafoam/Blue/Lilac used as signals only (no big fills).

Motion = stagger + meter fill; no zoom/bounce.

Desktop has clean alignment and consistent heights; tablet=2×2; mobile=stacked.

Placeholder icons used (no generated UI):
