Section 7 — Anonymity Promise (Brand Ribbon)

Goal
State the privacy guarantee in one, confident beat. Visually distinct, lightweight, and unmistakably Teammato.

Framing (ship this)

H2 (visually hidden for a11y, not shown): Anonymity promise

Sentence (displayed): We show themes, not people. Individual comments remain hidden until there’s enough input.

Keep it one sentence. No stats, no jargon.

Layout

Full-width ribbon centered in the content column (not edge-to-edge browser).

Ribbon size: 760–940px wide on desktop, responsive down.

Height: 88–104px (desktop).

Top offset from previous section: var(--space-L) = 72px.

Section padding: pt-20 pb-20.

Visual language

Background: Seafoam (--accent) at 85–90% tint (light).

Text: Deep-teal (--accent-fg) for AA+.

Icon: left-aligned Quad-lock glyph (a small lock inside a rounded cross) at 24–28px.

Quad watermark: a very faint (4–5% opacity) oversized quad embossed inside the ribbon, offset to the far right.

Border: 1px --border with subtle inner shadow (to feel pill-like).

Corners: fully rounded (max radii from your token).

No other icons, badges, or links inside the ribbon.

Motion (meaningful, minimal)

Reveal: slide in 4–6px with a soft fade when entering the viewport.

Quad watermark: static (no parallax here).

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Interaction

The ribbon is non-interactive by default. If you must link, add a tiny, right-aligned “Privacy details →” text link outside the ribbon, below it, in muted text.

Spacing & typography

Icon → headline gap: 12–16px.

Line length target: 48–64ch; keep to one line on desktop if possible, two on tablet/mobile.

Text size: same scale as subheads elsewhere (not a giant headline).

Mobile & tablet

Ribbon collapses to full width minus gutters.

Height reduces to 72–84px; icon 20–22px.

Text may wrap to two lines; maintain icon alignment left, watermark still faint on right.

Accessibility

Contrast AA+ for deep-teal on seafoam.

The visually hidden H2 gives the section a semantic landmark.

If a link is present below, ensure a visible teal focus ring and clear target wording (“Privacy details”).

Acceptance checklist

One sentence inside a single seafoam ribbon with a quad-lock icon—no extra UI.

Plenty of air above/below (72px from previous, 20px internal).

Quad watermark only inside the ribbon (not behind the section).

No buttons inside; optional small link sits below the ribbon.

Works at mobile widths without feeling cramped.

Matches color discipline: seafoam as signal, deep-teal text; tomato not used here.

Placeholder(s)

PLACEHOLDER: QUAD_LOCK_ICON (24–28px line icon).

Do not auto-generate art—use a neutral icon box if needed.
