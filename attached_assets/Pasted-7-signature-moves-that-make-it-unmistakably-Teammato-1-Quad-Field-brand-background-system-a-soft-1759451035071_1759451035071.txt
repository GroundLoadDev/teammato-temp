7 signature moves that make it unmistakably Teammato

1) Quad Field (brand background system)
a soft, generative “field” of rounded-cross quads that drifts behind sections (scale/opacity variance, 2–6%). it’s your core texture—replaces stripes/blobs.

hero: large quads, sparse.

content sections: tiny, denser grid that fades at the edges.

never full-bleed solid blocks; this field creates depth without heaviness.

2) Overlap & Lift (layer hierarchy)
break the card rectangle. let one hero element (modal crop or aggregate card) overlap the section boundary with a 1px teal outline and long, soft shadow (12–24px blur). this single overlap tells the eye “custom build,” not boilerplate.

3) Quad-Corner Cards (form factor)
standard cards feel generic. give key cards a lifted corner (one quadrant subtly elevated) to echo aggregation. it’s a tiny geometry change that sets the whole system apart.

4) Aggregation Meter (visual metaphor)
a horizontal strip of 4 faint quads that fill sequentially as “enough input” is reached. keep it abstract—no numbers—just a branded progress language. show it in hero and once more in the gallery.

5) Motion with meaning (not decoration)
micro-parallax on the quad field (0.5–1.5%); quadrants reveal in 80ms staggers when components appear. buttons depress (translate-y 1px + shadow change). avoid scale/zoom; use lift and reveal to feel tactile.

6) Seafoam, not blocks (accent discipline)
seafoam is for signals: strips, tags, headers, promise banner—not entire sections. most surfaces stay neutral; seafoam appears in thin doses (headers, side bars, chips). tomato red = micro-spark (icons/dots), never a fill.

7) Grain + Light (tactility)
add a whisper of subtle grain (1–2% noise) to large neutral areas and a soft top-left key light on hero objects. this breaks the “flat Tailwind” look without resorting to gradients.

What to change on the sample page (big, not small)

A) Hero

Replace the typography demo with one strong scene: left editorial headline; right a hero card that overlaps into the next section.

Behind it, the Quad Field large and sparse, slight parallax on scroll.

B) Aggregate Summary (make it the poster child)

Add the aggregation meter strip on top.

Use a quad-corner body with a seafoam header strip (not a full seafoam card).

Subtle long shadow + teal 1px outline.

C) Promise & Security

Promise banner = full-width seafoam ribbon (rounded ends), quad icon stamp on the left.

Security bar = three pills with icons; seafoam underlines, not fills.

D) Bento Trio

Break symmetry with uneven modules (40/30/30).

Put the Quad Field only behind the center panel (lighter field elsewhere).

Each tile has one unique shape cue (corner lift, header strip, or side rail), not all at once.

E) Buttons & Inputs

Demonstrate press physics (translate-y + shadow).

Inputs show teal focus and one inline rule hint state (no @mentions) purely as a visual pattern, not content.

F) Rhythm

Vary vertical spacing intentionally: hero (very tall), summary (tall), promise (short), security (compact), bento (tall). this creates a scroll melody.

Brand guardrails (avoid “same-y”)

no centered H1 on marketing pages.

no gradient blobs or Memphis humans.

no full seafoam cards; use strips/rails/badges.

no four equal cards in a row; if you must, break the grid with one taller card.

never use tomato red as a background.

Experience tests (to judge the next build)

Silhouette test: squint—do you see one element breaking the section edge (overlap & lift)?

Signature test: can you spot three brand cues above the fold (quad field, quad-corner card, aggregation meter)?

Texture test: does the neutral background feel slightly tactile (grain), not sterile?

Motion test: do quads reveal/stagger and buttons depress? no zooms.

Discipline test: is seafoam used in strips and tags rather than big blocks?

Optional “wow” idea (still lightweight)

Interactive Quad Field: on hover, nearby quads gently rotate 3–5° and brighten by 5%—a “soft pulse” that feels alive but not gamey. it’s one tiny JS hook, huge perceived craft.
