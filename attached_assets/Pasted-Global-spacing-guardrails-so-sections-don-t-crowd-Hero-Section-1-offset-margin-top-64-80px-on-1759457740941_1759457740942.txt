Global spacing guardrails (so sections don’t crowd)

Hero → Section 1 offset: margin-top: 64–80px on Section 1 (desktop). The hero’s overlapping modal may sit visually closer; the section cards should still start ~64px below the hero copy block.

Section paddings (desktop):

Hero: pt-96 / pb-48 (or visually equivalent).

Section 1 (Install strip): pt-24 / pb-28.

Card elevation rhythm: long, soft shadow (12–18px blur, low opacity). Hover = shadow only; no scale.

Mobile/tablet: reduce above values by ~30% (tablet) and ~45% (mobile).

Image placeholders (use these exact labels):

PLACEHOLDER: OAUTH_SCREENSHOT (Tile 1)

PLACEHOLDER: MODAL_CROP_SBI (Tile 2)

PLACEHOLDER: ACTION_POST_CARD (Tile 3)
Replit should not synthesize UI—drop these images in later.

Section 2 — Aggregate Summary (poster component)

Purpose
Be the “movie poster” for Teammato: show what leaders actually see—safe aggregation, themes, and an action chip. This is the visual proof that we’re not just collecting venting.

Layout

One wide card, centered. Max width 880–960px on desktop.

Section padding: pt-40 / pb-36.

Top spacing from Section 1: additional mt-56 (or 80–96px) so the poster breathes.

Structure inside the card

Seafoam header strip (56–64px tall)

Left: Topic title and tiny “k met” hint (no numbers).

Right: cohort dots (8–10 fixed positions; 2–3 seafoam tones).

Teal L-frame: 1px outline that hugs top + left edges of the card only.

Body

Line: “Based on anonymous submissions (min threshold reached).” (plain, no k jargon)

Theme bullets (2–3)—each bullet in a soft capsule row.

Action row: “You said → We did” action chip (success tint) with one concise action beneath.

Brand form factor

Quad-corner emphasis: simulate a lifted top-left corner using a corner-biased shadow; do not change radius.

Single container owns border + radius (no seams between header and body).

Shadow: longer blur (16–20px), lower opacity; ensure parent allows overflow so it isn’t clipped.

Color & accents

Header background: seafoam (--accent) with deep-teal text.

Dots: seafoam tones only; no green checks—keep it abstract.

One tomato micro-dot in this section: inside the action icon only.

Motion (meaningful)

Cohort dots fill in a left→right stagger (80ms) when the card enters view.

Action chip slides in 4–6px with a soft ease.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Accessibility

Deep-teal text on seafoam to maintain AA contrast.

Focus rings visible on any interactive chips/links inside the card.

Mobile & tablet

Max width becomes full-bleed minus gutters; header compresses to 48px.

Dots reduce to 6 positions (still fixed; never wrap).

Body uses 2 themes + action to avoid crowding.

Acceptance checklist

One wide poster card, centered, with generous white space above/below.

L-frame aligns perfectly to card edges; no double borders or seams.

Cohort dots are fixed and never wrap; header and body radii match.

Exactly one tomato micro-accent in the section.

Motion = dots stagger + chip slide; no zooms.

Card reads like “what leaders get,” not a mock graph.
