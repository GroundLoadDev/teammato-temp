Likely culprits (and what to check)

Double border / seam at the header join

Header strip and body card probably each have their own border/radius, creating a faint seam.

Fix: one border for the whole component; header sits inside the card with matching radius.

Clipped shadow

Parent container may have overflow: hidden or the card is inside a masked section (quad field).

Fix: allow overflow on the parent of the card so the long, soft shadow renders cleanly.

Mismatched radii

Header radius ≠ body radius (or the “lifted corner” has a different value).

Fix: ensure top-left/top-right radii on header match the card exactly; lifted corner is a shadow trick, not a different radius.

L-frame outline misalignment

The teal L outline can be 1–2px off due to padding/positioning, creating an optical wobble.

Fix: ensure it’s anchored to the card’s outer box, not to the header’s inner content box.

Cohort dots wrapping

If those dots are in a flex row, they may wrap or jitter at certain widths.

Fix: make them a fixed-width group (no wrap), or cap the count for the demo.

Inner shadow on content area too strong

A subtle inner shadow helps separation, but too much reads as a “dent.”

Fix: reduce opacity/blur; keep it barely perceptible.

Seafoam band contrast

Seafoam header text/icons might be using muted slate; looks washed on some displays.

Fix: use deep-teal text for anything on seafoam.

Z-index / stacking collisions with the quad field

The background quad might be sitting above the card’s header in the stacking order, causing odd overlaps.

Fix: put the quad field behind the section content (lower z), or tuck it into a separate pseudo-element.

Spacing rhythm off by ~8–12px

The gap between header strip and checklist might be too big, making the header feel “detached.”

Fix: tighten that gap slightly so the strip feels bonded to the content.

Tomato micro-dots visible in awkward spots

I see tiny red dots mid-page (good brand touch), but one appears under the promise banner—reads like an error.

Fix: keep only one tomato dot per screen, and anchor it to a component (e.g., action icon), not free-floating.
