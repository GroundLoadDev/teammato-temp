Option A — Recurring “General feedback” (Rolling windows) ✅ recommended

What it is: One logical topic (“General feedback”) that auto-spawns time-boxed instances (e.g., week or month).

Examples: General feedback — 2025-W41, then … W42, or General feedback — Oct 2025.

Behavior:

New submissions automatically go to the current instance (no human needed).

When an instance expires, you archive it (read-only) and auto-create the next instance.

Release rule: publish aggregates only if the instance hit k; otherwise roll themes into the next instance or keep for admin-only trend tracking.

Pros: Always open; clean archives; metrics by period; easy to communicate (“this week’s general feedback”).

Cons: You’ll have multiple archived instances (normal and useful).

Implementation notes

Table: topics has a parent row (general_feedback) + child rows per period (topic_instances).

Routing: /teammato <free text> → prefill Behavior → default Topic = current General instance.

UI: App Home shows “General feedback — closes in X days.” Previous instances listed under “Past summaries.”

Option B — Single “General feedback” with a Sliding window

What it is: One topic that’s always open; you compute k on a sliding period (e.g., last 21 days) when releasing summaries.

Pros: No instance management.

Cons: Harder to do tidy archives (“what was last month’s?”). Reports can feel “moving target.”

Option C — Continuous topic + Scheduled snapshots

What it is: One always-open topic; you take a snapshot on a schedule (weekly/monthly) and release the snapshot if it meets k.

Pros: Simple author flow + tidy reports.

Cons: You still need snapshot logic (close-out markers) — effectively similar to Option A under the hood.

Recommended default

Option A: Recurring instances, weekly cadence, k≥5.
It’s the most intuitive: keeps anonymity math clear, creates predictable “cadence” for leaders, and requires zero manual creation.

Default settings

Instance length: 14–21 days for small orgs, 7 days for larger orgs.

Auto-create next instance: 24 hours before current expires.

Carry-over rule: If an instance <k at expiry, carry its items forward for analysis but don’t publish; the next instance starts fresh for release.

Naming: General feedback — 2025-W41 (week) or General feedback — Oct 2025 (month).

UI copy: “General feedback — closes in 3 days. We publish an aggregate summary when there’s enough input.”

Edge cases handled

Submission during switchover: Route to whichever instance has the later close time (or add a 30-min “grace window”).

Backfill to a real topic: If admins tag an item from General → “Tooling friction,” move it to that topic’s current instance and re-count for k.

Tiny teams: Increase k (e.g., 7–9) and lengthen the window (21–28 days).

Minimal engineering to enable it

Schema: topic_parent(id, name) + topic_instance(id, parent_id, window_start, window_end, state).

Cron/worker: Nightly job that (a) closes expired instances, (b) creates the next instance, (c) triggers aggregation if k met.

Routing: Submission resolver that maps “General feedback” → the current open instance by NOW() BETWEEN window_start AND window_end.

Release guard: Summaries show only aggregate themes from that instance; no example quotes until anonymization checks pass.
