Who’s the primary buyer?

Primary economic buyer: Head of People / HR Director at 100–2,000-person orgs.

KPI-minded (retention, engagement, ER issues, manager quality).

Needs anonymous intake that employees actually use, without adding a new system.

Core champions / co-buyers:

Engineering/Product leaders (want fast, actionable signal in Slack).

CISO/Security (privacy & compliance gatekeeper).

Legal/Compliance (serious concerns routing).

Influencers: Exec assistants, ERGs, IC “culture carriers,” and RevOps/IT (implementation friction).

The #1 problem Teammato solves (that others don’t)

**It makes safe-to-say feedback actually happen in the flow of work—**by combining Slack-native capture, light SBI guidance, and enforceable anonymity (k-anonymous aggregation + pseudonymous handles + data minimization).
Competitors do long surveys, portals, or “anonymous DMs.” They either feel risky (identifiable metadata), live outside Slack (low completion), or produce venting instead of actionable, behavior-focused signal. Teammato uniquely delivers: high participation + safe anonymity + actionable output + a visible “You said → We did” loop.

Tone / vibe

Trust-first, human, and competent.

Primary: Privacy-first enterprise (calm, precise, plain English).

Secondary: Scientific & psychological (light touch—explain the why without jargon).

Tertiary: Modern startup warmth (approachable, not cutesy).

Voice traits: Calm, candid, specific, bias-to-action, zero drama.
Avoid: hype, scare tactics, buzzword soup, snark.

Brands to emulate (and why)

1Password / Proton — trust and plain-English security.

Stripe — rigorous docs and credibility without heaviness.

Linear / Notion — focus, crisp UI, modern product storytelling.

Slack — friendly tone and in-product clarity.

Vercel — performance + developer empathy (for our install story).

“Heavy opinions” (non-negotiables)

Anonymity is enforceable, not performative.

k-anonymous aggregation by default; never release single submissions.

No @mentions or names in open feedback; person-level only in opt-in 360 with group minimums.

Data minimization.

No IP/UA in feedback tables; pseudonymous submitter hashes for rate limiting only.

Coarsen Situation details; default retention 365 days; legal hold supported.

Security by design, not by promise.

AEAD encryption with per-org keys; SOC 2, pen tests, 24/7 monitoring.

RBAC + tenant isolation (RLS). Clear audit trails.

In-Slack first.

Modal capture as the primary path; advanced web handoff only when needed.

Low cognitive load, fast completion, mobile-friendly.

Action over venting.

Light SBI prompts (Behavior & Impact required).

“You said → We did” status is part of the product, not an optional PM ritual.

Accessibility & clarity.

Light theme default, AA contrast, keyboard focus rings, plain-language microcopy.

No dark patterns.

No mystery counters (“how many reported”); no bait-and-switch anonymity claims.

How this translates into design, layout & branding

Homepage hero:

Outcome first: “Hear the truth at work—safely, in Slack.”

Subcopy: “Anonymous by default, behavior-focused by design, built for action.”

Primary CTA: “Add to Slack” + secondary “See how it works” (scroll to a 4-step).

Section order:

How it works (4 tiles, screens of modal → aggregate → action post).

Why it’s safe (three proof points: anonymity, encryption, data controls).

Why it’s useful (actionability, completion rates, in-Slack flow).

For HR / for Managers / for Security (tabs with tailored benefits).

Social proof (logo bar or 1–2 short quotes).

Install steps + pricing CTA.

Visual system:

Teal/navy palette (trust) with tomato accent (Option B: red fruit + teal stem).

Inter / IBM Plex Serif / JetBrains Mono (already picked).

Light, airy, generous whitespace; subtle shadows; rounded 0.8rem.

Screenshots: modal with prompts, anonymized aggregate, “You said → We did” card.

Icons: simple line + soft fills; avoid alert reds except destructive actions.

Key messages to repeat:

Anonymous by default.

In Slack, not another portal.

Clear, behavior-focused input.

Aggregate summaries only.

“You said → We did.”
