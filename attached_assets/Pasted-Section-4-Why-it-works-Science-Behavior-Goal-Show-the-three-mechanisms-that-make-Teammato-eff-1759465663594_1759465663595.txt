Section 4 — Why it works (Science + Behavior)

Goal
Show the three mechanisms that make Teammato effective and safe—lower risk, clearer input, in-flow capture—and demonstrate them visually (not with essays).

Framing (ship this)

H2: Why it works

Subhead (one line): Lower risk, clearer input, and in-flow capture—so feedback turns into action.

Layout (one tall section, three rows)
Row A — Mechanisms (3 tiles, asymmetric)

Grid: 45% / 27.5% / 27.5%

Spacing: mt: 24px, tile padding 24px, gap 20px

Tile 1 — Lower risk

Title: Anonymous by default → more people speak up

Visual: Aggregation meter (4 quads) aligned under the title.

Shape cue: Seafoam side rail (6–8px) on the left (signal = safety).

Micro note (tiny): Individual comments remain hidden until there’s enough input.

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: METER_STRIP

Tile 2 — Clearer input

Title: SBI prompts → behavior, not blame

Visual: miniature SBI microcard with Behavior/Impact rows (no text entry fields).

Guardrail tag: small pill: No names/@ (muted).

Shape cue: Support Blue header strip (#E9F3FF).

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: SBI_MICROCARD

Tile 3 — In-flow capture

Title: Slack-native → higher completion

Visual: tiny Install → Modal → Submit strip (three icons with arrows).

Shape cue: Lilac corner lift (shadow backplate, no radius change).

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: THREE_STEP_STRIP

Color discipline

Seafoam only as rail/strip signals; Blue/Lilac used sparingly (≤10% of viewport combined).

No full-tint backgrounds.

Motion

Tiles stagger in (80ms).

Meter quads fill sequentially (80ms per quad).

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Row B — Transform (Before → After)

Proves the prompting improves quality.

Layout: two cards side-by-side (Before / After), equal width.

Before card (neutral):

Header: “Before”

Body line: “The launch was bad and stressful.” (vague)

After card (seafoam header strip):

Header: “After (behavior + impact)”

Body line: “Rescheduling the handoff twice caused rework; QA rushed fixes late Friday.” (specific)

Between cards: a small chip: Prompt nudges applied with a mini checklist (3 items):

Start with a verb

Describe the behavior

Include the impact

Motion: a soft underline sweep highlights the changed words in the After card (single pass, ~300ms).

Placeholders:

PLACEHOLDER: BEFORE_CARD

PLACEHOLDER: AFTER_CARD

Guardrails (below the pair, compact list)

Inline checklist (single row):
Block @mentions, Coarsen dates/places, Aggregate before release

Do not turn this into a big card; keep it a single-line checklist with icons.

Row C — Receipts (Fact strip)

A slim rail with three receipts (mini book icons + labels). Link to deep dive.

Receipts:

Lower perceived risk → higher disclosure

Behavior-focused input → more action taken

In-flow capture → higher completion than portals

Right-aligned link: Read the research → (to /trust#research)

Behavior: desktop wraps (no scrollbar); mobile horizontal snap with hidden scrollbar.

Spacing

Top offset from Section 3: var(--space-L) = 72px

Section padding: pt-28 pb-36 (desktop), pt-20 pb-28 (tablet), pt-16 pb-24 (mobile)

Row gaps: 32px between Row A/B and Row B/C.

Accessibility

AA contrast on all tints (deep-teal text on seafoam; deep blue/violet on support tints).

All chips and pills have visible teal focus rings.

Motion respects reduced-motion.

Acceptance checklist (must pass)

Section contains exactly: H2, one-line subhead, Row A (3 asymmetric tiles), Row B (Before/After + guardrails inline), Row C (receipts rail).

No paragraphs longer than one line.

Seafoam/Blue/Lilac used as signals only (rails/headers/backplates).

Aggregation meter and Before→After animations are subtle and meaningful; no zooms.

No “example” wording anywhere; labels are product-tone, not mockup-tone.

One tomato micro-accent total in this section (e.g., a tiny dot in the guardrails lock icon), or skip if distracting.
