Prompt: Update the Teammato Design Sample Page (No New Globals)

Goal: Transform the existing design sample/preview page into a branded Teammato Design Gallery that looks bespoke (not stock shadcn), demonstrates our Quad system (rounded cross motif), and uses the seafoam accent instead of the current amber/brown. Do not add global CSS; consume only our live theme tokens via CSS variables/Tailwind arbitrary values.

Constraints

No new global styles or resets. Read the live theme tokens (e.g., --bg, --fg, --primary, --accent, --accent-fg, --border, --focus, --card, --card-fg, --danger, --danger-fg, optional --chart-1..5).

Replace accent: use seafoam accent

--accent = #E6FAF6

--accent-fg = #0F4F49
(If tokens are locked, simulate by using inline style={{ background: 'var(--accent)' }} etc.—but do not overwrite globals.)

Reserve tomato red for tiny highlights only (icons/dots), not banners.

Light mode only.

No yellow/brown UI anywhere.

Page Structure (sections & what to show)

Header (brand sampler)

Left: Teammato wordmark or text.

Right: small legend pill “Reading live theme tokens”.

Subtle background Quad watermark (rounded cross) very low opacity (4–6%), aligned top-right.

Type & Hierarchy panel (editorial look)

Left-aligned serif H1 (our marketing headline).

H2/H3, card title, paragraph, muted paragraph, monospace sample.

Under the H1, faint Quad mask (as a background shape behind text).

Signature Modules (make us look unique)

Aggregate Summary Card (wide):

Quad header (4 small dots or mini-quads).

2–3 “theme” bullets + one “You said → We did” chip.

Seafoam accent strip for the header.

Anonymity Promise Banner (full width):

Seafoam background, deep-teal text:
“We show themes, not people. Individual comments remain hidden until there’s enough input.”

Security Fact Bar (horizontal):

Three big facts with check icons:
“Per-org keys • No IPs in feedback tables • Row-level isolation (RLS)”

Buttons sampler

Primary, Accent (secondary), Ghost, Destructive.

Show hover/active/focus states.

Use teal focus ring from token.

Inputs sampler

Text input + textarea + select mock.

Show placeholders from our SBI microcopy (Behavior/Impact/Situation).

Emphasize visible focus state (teal).

Cards & Banners

Basic Card (neutral)

Accent Card (now seafoam, not yellow)

Hoverable Card (subtle elevation change; no scale)

Include a Quad-corner variant: one corner subtly lifted (shadow) to hint “aggregation.”

How It Works (Bento trio)

3 uneven panels (break the grid symmetry):

Capture in Slack (modal crop)

Anonymous by default (quad + lock icon)

You said → We did (example action card)

Each panel uses a different Quad placement (background watermark), keeping motion subtle.

Charts palette chips

Display --chart-1…--chart-5 if defined; otherwise show muted placeholders with labels.

Footer

Small text: “Design Gallery · All components read live theme tokens.”

Visual System & Motions (apply to this page only)

Quad motif = rounded cross; use as low-opacity background mask behind hero text, headers, and one accent card.

Motion: sequential reveal of quadrants (80ms stagger) when the Quad is used. Cards elevate 2px on hover (shadow change only). Buttons depress on click (shadow + translate-y 1px).

Typography: IBM Plex Serif for headings (H1/H2), Inter for others, JetBrains Mono for code.

Spacing: airy; use generous py-12/py-16 between sections.

Alignment: editorial—left-aligned H1; avoid centered everywhere.

Copy to Use (exact strings)

H1: “Hear the truth at work—safely, in Slack.”

Subhead: “Anonymous by default. Behavior-focused by design. Built for action.”

Anonymity Promise: “We show themes, not people. Individual comments remain hidden until there’s enough input.”

Security facts: “Per-org keys • No IPs in feedback tables • Row-level isolation (RLS)”

Aggregate Summary bullets (sample):

“Clarify scope before demos”

“Share sprint goals earlier”

“Add QA sign-off checklist”

Action chip: “You said → We did”

Acceptance Criteria (review checklist)

The accent is seafoam with deep-teal text; no yellow/brown appears.

The Quad motif is visible in at least 3 places (hero/type panel watermark, aggregate card header, one accent card), at low opacity.

Buttons, inputs, cards only use theme tokens (var(--*))—no Tailwind default color classes.

Visible teal focus rings on interactive elements.

At least one asymmetric layout (Bento trio) to avoid “four equal cards” sameness.

Motion is subtle; no large scales or gradient blobs.

Page feels bespoke to Teammato (aggregation/quad + seafoam/teal + editorial headings).

What NOT to include

No gradient blobs, Memphis people, or blue-purple stock gradients.

No center-aligned H1.

No “warning yellow” accent or brown text blocks.

No table-heavy sections; keep it card-based and editorial.
