Section 1: “Install Moments” Strip (90 seconds to value)
Purpose

Show the whole journey in three beats—Install → Capture → Publish—using distinct shapes and subtle color tints so it feels lively, not monochrome.

Layout

Asymmetric bento: 45% / 27.5% / 27.5% (desktop).

Order: Install • Capture • Publish.

Height: medium-tall tiles (so imagery breathes).

Visual language & color (small global upgrade)

Keep teal/seafoam as primary, and introduce two supporting tints used only for small surfaces:

Support Blue (mist): #E9F3FF (text on it: #093B76)
Use for header strips, small icon containers, and thin rails.

Support Lilac (soft): #F3EEFF (text on it: #3E2A78)
Use for corner-lift backplates, tiny badges, and chart chips.

Rules

Tints appear on <15% of any screen combined.

Never use Support tints as full section backgrounds.

Seafoam remains the accent for “safety / privacy” signals; teal remains action.

Tomato stays micro-only (1 tiny dot per viewport).

Tile designs (one unique cue per tile)
Tile 1 — Install

Shape cue: Support Blue side rail (6–8px) running full height on the left.

Imagery: OAuth screenshot crop (button row visible).

Micro-elements: tiny quad watermark in upper-right of the tile (very faint).

Copy style: short label only, e.g., “Connect in seconds”.

Tile 2 — Capture

Shape cue: Seafoam header strip (signals safety).

Imagery: SBI modal crop (Behavior & Impact visible).

Micro-elements: “Aggregation meter” mini (4 quads; static here).

Copy style: “Behavior & Impact—Situation optional”.

Tile 3 — Publish

Shape cue: Lilac corner lift (top-right only) as a backplate shadow (not a different radius).

Imagery: “You said → We did” action post card.

Micro-elements: 1 tomato-red dot in the action icon (and nowhere else on the strip).

Copy style: “Share actions—without exposing anyone”.

Background

Quad Field only behind Tile 2 (lightest of the three).

No additional patterns behind Tiles 1 and 3 (they rely on their shape cues).

Motion (meaningful, subtle)

On scroll-in: tiles stagger 80ms left→right.

Side rail slides in 4–6px; header strip reveals with a soft wipe; corner lift raises via shadow only (no scale).

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Mobile & tablet

Tablet: Keep three tiles in a row; reduce rail thickness and header height slightly.

Mobile: Stack tiles vertically; preserve shape cues (rail becomes a top bar on Tile 1; corner lift becomes a small lifted corner shadow on Tile 3).

Accessibility

Text on Support Blue/Lilac uses deep-blue/deep-violet specified above to maintain AA contrast.

All interactive elements show teal focus rings.

Acceptance checklist (quick review)

Clear asymmetry (first tile wider).

Each tile uses one distinct cue: rail / header / corner-lift—no mixing.

Support Blue & Lilac appear as small surfaces only (strips, rails, badges).

Seafoam appears in the Capture tile header; teal remains action.

Exactly one tomato micro-dot in the strip (on Publish icon).

Motion uses stagger + reveal, no zooms.

Quad Field visible only behind the center tile.
