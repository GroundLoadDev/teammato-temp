Awesome—here’s a clean phased plan. I kept your existing ticket IDs, grouped them by dependency and impact. No timelines mentioned.

Phase 0 — Prep & Consistency (prevents rework)

STR-240 Lookup key normalization

Unify on cap_<cap>_{m|a}; add scripts README; CI guard that verifies catalog.

AC: Checkout works for every cap; CI fails on mismatches.

BILL-140 Stripe webhooks + mirror

POST /api/stripe/webhook for subscription.*, invoice.*, checkout.session.completed; mirror fields: status, current_period_end, cancel_at_period_end, seat_cap, period, price_id, customer_id, subscription_id.

AC: Org billing state updates within seconds of Stripe changes; Billing UI reflects current_period_end and price_id.

AUD-120 Audience nightly sync

Nightly job + on-install/on-save recount of eligible_count, last_synced.

AC: eligible_count never >24h stale; manual “Recalculate” still works.

Phase 1 — Activation & First Value (gets users to the “Aha”)

SLK-180 Installer DM + ack<2s + uninstall

DM on install with audience coach + icebreaker; command handler acks <2s; handle app_uninstalled.

AC: DM reliably sent on OAuth success; slash commands always ack within 2s; uninstall revokes tokens/cleans rows.

DIG-101 Weekly Digest MVP

cron/digestWeekly.ts (k-gated from views), Admin Preview component, POST /api/digests/sendNow; use themes if present, fallback to Top Threads.

AC: Preview shows only k-safe items; “Send now” posts real digest; weekly cron sends for orgs with ≥3 threads; logs include counts only.

Phase 2 — Monetization & Fair Use (turns value into paid)

ENF-160 Seat-cap middleware

Server middleware on write: warn at ≥90%, start 7-day grace at >100%, block new posts at >110% or grace expiry; read/export always allowed; auto-manage graceEndsAt.

AC: Over-cap writes return 403 with guidance; grace auto-creates/resets; reads/exports unaffected.

NOTIF-260 Cap threshold notifications

Slack DM + email at 90%, >100% (grace start), and >110%/grace expiry; idempotent (one per threshold per 7d).

AC: Notifications fire exactly once per threshold window and include Upgrade & Audience links.

TRUST-220 Inline trust copy

Add trust bullets adjacent to Upgrade/Checkout and first-run: “XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD,” “Plaintext never stored,” “PII scrubbed,” link DPA/Trust.

AC: Copy is visible on first-run, Billing, and Checkout; language matches Trust page.

Phase 3 — Safety Hardening & Compliance (removes silent blockers)

KSAFE-280 Exports → k-views + tests

Route all exports through v_threads, v_comments, v_thread_participants; add integration tests that seed small-n and assert suppression; CI rule to forbid base-table access in export code.

AC: Tests pass proving suppression; CI blocks PRs that query base tables from export paths.

Security hardening mini-epics (can split)

KEY-ROT-300 DEK rotation job (monthly) + metadata + canary org validation.

LOG-310 Logging audit to prove no plaintext; add guardrails/tests.

AC: Rotation produces verifiable audit trail; log scan finds no plaintext; tests enforce both.

Phase 4 — Measurement & Optimization (prove what works)

ANA-200 Event instrumentation v1

Server-side, content-free events: audience_configured, audience_k_safe_reached, thread_created, digest_sent{manual|weekly}, digest_viewed, billing_checkout_opened, upgrade_succeeded, seatcap_warn_shown, post_blocked_overcap; append-only events table; basic funnel chart (Metabase/SQL).

AC: Funnel visible for a test org from install → paid; events backfill into dashboard.

UX-330 Storybook for Billing states (optional but helpful)

Document banners: trial countdown, near-cap, over-cap, grace, past_due, canceled.

AC: Designers/PMs can review copy/states without staging.

Cross-phase dependencies (at a glance)

DIG-101 depends on AUD-120 (accurate eligible_count) and benefits from SLK-180 (installer DM seeds content).

ENF-160 depends on BILL-140 (mirror state + grace windows) and AUD-120 (correct denominator).

NOTIF-260 relies on ENF-160 thresholds and BILL-140 dates.

KSAFE-280 strengthens DIG-101 output integrity and any export UI.

ANA-200 should wrap all of the above to show activation → conversion.

If you want, I can turn this directly into your issue tracker with labels (phase:0–4, area:slack|billing|digest|security, severity:blocker|major|normal) and paste in the AC exactly as above.
