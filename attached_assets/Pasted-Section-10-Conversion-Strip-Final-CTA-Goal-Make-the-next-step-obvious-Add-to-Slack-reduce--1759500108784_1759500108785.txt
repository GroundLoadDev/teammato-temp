Section 10 — Conversion Strip (Final CTA)

Goal
Make the next step obvious (“Add to Slack”), reduce risk with one privacy reminder, and avoid clutter. This is not a pricing table—just a confident handoff.

Framing (ship this)

Headline (H2 scale): Start free in Slack

Subhead (one line): Install in minutes. Anonymous by default. Built for action.

Layout

Container: one centered CTA card on a neutral background.

Card width: 760–920px (desktop).

Card padding: 24–28px; internal gap 16–20px.

Top offset from Trust preview: var(--space-L) = **72px`.

Section padding: pt-28 pb-36.

Inside the card (vertical stack):

Headline + subhead (centered on desktop only)

Primary CTA button: Add to Slack

Secondary actions (inline, muted):

View pricing

Talk to sales

Mini reassurance row (muted, tiny icons):

Anonymous by default

SOC 2 audited

Remove anytime

Keep it to these four layers—no extra badges or screenshots here.

Visual language

Card: --card bg, 1px --border, long soft shadow (12–18px blur, low opacity), rounded corners (your token).

Primary button: --primary bg with press physics (translate-y 1px on active).

Secondary links: muted text with underline on hover (no buttons).

Seafoam usage: tiny underline under the headline or a small chip that reads “No credit card” (optional).

Tomato micro-accent: 1 tiny dot in the Slack icon on the primary button or omit if it clashes.

Motion

Section fade-in + 4–6px upward slide.

Button hover = shadow lift only (no scale).

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Spacing rules

Headline → subhead: 8–12px

Subhead → primary CTA: 16–20px

CTA → secondary links row: 12–16px

Links row → reassurance row: 12px

Generous whitespace above/below the card so it reads as the final step.

Microcopy (ship as written or adjust minimally)

Secondary links: View pricing · Talk to sales

Reassurance items (tiny): Anonymous by default · SOC 2 audited · Remove anytime

Mobile & tablet

Full-width card minus gutters.

Stack secondary links on a single line if they fit; otherwise stack to two lines with equal spacing.

Keep the reassurance row as three small chips; they can wrap (no scrollbar).

Accessibility

Primary CTA has visible teal focus ring and accessible name “Add to Slack”.

Links have clear targets and focus rings.

Contrast AA+ for all text; deep-teal text on any seafoam chip.

Button area is large enough for touch (≥44px height).

Acceptance checklist (must pass)

Section contains one CTA card with headline, subhead, one primary button, two secondary links, and one reassurance row—nothing else.

No pricing tables or extra badges here; it’s a single call to action.

Seafoam appears only as a small signal (underline or chip).

Exactly zero or one tomato micro-accent (inside Slack icon only).

Shadow not clipped; generous whitespace around the card.

Desktop centers the block; mobile scales gracefully.

Placeholders (if needed)

None required (no screenshots). If your button includes a Slack icon, use PLACEHOLDER: ICON_SLACK.
