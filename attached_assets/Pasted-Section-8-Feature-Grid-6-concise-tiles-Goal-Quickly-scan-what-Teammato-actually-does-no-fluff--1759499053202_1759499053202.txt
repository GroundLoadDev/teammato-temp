Section 8 — Feature Grid (6 concise tiles)

Goal
Quickly scan what Teammato actually does—no fluff. Six tight tiles, each with a title + one-line benefit and a small on-brand shape cue.

Framing (ship this)

H2: What you get

Subhead (one line): The essentials for safe capture, clear input, and visible follow-through—built for Slack.

Layout

Grid: 2 rows × 3 columns (desktop).

Top offset from previous section: 72px (var(--space-L)).

Section padding: pt-24 pb-32.

Tile size: 260–300px wide × 160–190px tall.

Gaps: 20–24px.

The 6 tiles (title + one-liner)

Slack-native capture
“Open the modal from App Home or /teammato—no extra portal.”
Shape cue: Support Blue header strip (#E9F3FF).
Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: ICON_SLACK_MODAL

Anonymous by default
“You see themes—not people. Individual comments aren’t exposed.”
Shape cue: Seafoam side rail (privacy signal).
Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: ICON_ANON

SBI prompts for clarity
“Behavior & Impact required; fewer rants, more signal.”
Shape cue: Quad-corner lift (shadow only).
Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: ICON_SBI

Aggregate summaries only
“Results release when there’s enough input—no one stands out.”
Shape cue: Mini aggregation meter (4 quads) inline, static.
Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: ICON_METER

Topics & rolling ‘General’
“Run time-boxed topics and a persistent ‘General feedback’ stream.”
Shape cue: Lilac corner backplate behind icon.
Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: ICON_TOPICS

Actions in Slack
“Publish ‘You said → We did’ updates to close the loop.”
Shape cue: none (keep this one clean); tomato micro-dot inside the action icon (this section only).
Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: ICON_ACTION_POST

If you prefer a security tile here, swap any tile for:
Per-org encryption & isolation — “AEAD at rest, TLS in transit, RLS for tenant isolation.”
Shape cue: seafoam underline only. PLACEHOLDER: ICON_LOCK

Visual rules

No full tint fills. Blue/Lilac/Seafoam appear as strips/rails/backplates only.

Icons: line + soft fill, stroke ≈ 1.75, consistent set.

Text stays to one line; truncate with ellipsis if needed.

Seafoam = privacy signal; teal = action; tomato appears once (Tile 6 icon dot).

Motion

Tiles reveal with 80ms stagger left→right, top→bottom.

Hover = shadow lift only; no scale.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Spacing & rhythm

H2 → Subhead: 8–12px

Subhead → Grid: 16–20px

Tile internal padding: 20–24px

Maintain consistent heights; avoid wrapping to a third line.

Mobile & tablet

Tablet: 2×3 grid.

Mobile: 1 column × 6 tiles; keep shape cues; ensure icons stay 20–24px.

Accessibility

AA contrast on all text (deep-teal on seafoam; deep blue/violet on support tints).

Any clickable tile or “Learn more” link shows a teal focus ring.

Acceptance checklist

Exactly 6 tiles, clean and even; no extra badges or metrics.

Each tile uses at most one shape cue; no seafoam fills.

Copy = 1 title + 1 line; no paragraphs.

One tomato micro-accent total (Tile 6 icon).

Grid aligns perfectly on desktop; stacks gracefully on smaller screens.
