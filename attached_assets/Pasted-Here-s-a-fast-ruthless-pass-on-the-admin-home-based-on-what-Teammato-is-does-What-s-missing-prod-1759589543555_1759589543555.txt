Here’s a fast, ruthless pass on the admin home based on what Teammato is/does.

What’s missing (product-level)

Trial/plan status & usage meter. Top-right chip (“Trial: X days left” or “Pro • Annual”), plus a meter: Detected Slack members N / Seat cap. Warn at 90%, grace to 110%, then read-only messaging. Add “Upgrade” CTA inline.

Digest & channel status. Surface the configured channel, next scheduled digest time, and a “Send sample now” action. If unset, turn the “Setup Progress” item into a guided step.

K-anonymity context. A small explainer next to “Ready Threads” with the active threshold (e.g., “k=5”) and a link to why some items aren’t shown yet. Allow quick edit of k in Settings.

Moderation health. Card for flags in the last 7 days (toxicity/PII/spam), with a “Review queue” button.

Retention/legal-hold badge. Show current retention window and whether legal hold is on; link to Settings → Retention.

Export & audit. Tiny utilities strip: “Export data” (metadata-only, signed URL) and “View admin audit.”

Environment banner. If APP_ENV=test, show a subtle “Test Mode” ribbon for owners/admins.

What’s missing (activation UX)

Post-install checklist, not a generic list. Replace “Setup Progress” with stateful steps:

Slack connected ✔ (show team & installer)

Pick channel ➜

Seed topics ➜

Submit a test via /teammato ➜

Schedule digest ➜

Invite a moderator ➜

Review analytics
Each step should show live state + one obvious next action.

Inline Slack tips. A mini “How to post” with /teammato <message>, and “help/about” examples.

Card/metric nits

Metric framing. “Ready Threads” is great; add “New this week” and “Active participants” (k-safe counts). Make each metric clickable to its filtered view.

Recent activity. Expand “Recent Feedback” to include comments/reactions (still anonymous), with tiny topic chips and k-status icons.

Empty states. When counts are zero, use action-oriented empties (“Connect Slack”, “Seed topics”, “Try /teammato in Slack”).

Billing UI you’ll want soon

Billing summary tile. Plan name, term, next bill date, “Manage billing” (Stripe portal), and the usage meter mentioned above. Trigger upgrade from here and from warnings.

Over-cap/read-only banners. Global, dismissible banners for “approaching cap”, “over cap (grace)”, and “trial expired (read-only)”.

Reliability/ops surfacing

Slack connection health. Timestamp of last successful command/event, and a quick “Re-check” action. Show uninstall protection (events handler) status.

Status/health link. Tiny footer link to health check + status page for outages.

Microcopy / layout tweaks

Tone: empower, not police. The current copy is neutral (good). Keep the “no meetings” ethos off this page; focus on guidance and next actions.

Button affordances. The lone “Start” button on “Review Analytics” is easy to miss. Make each step’s primary action full-width on the row, with a secondary “Learn more”.

Quick wins you can ship immediately

Add a top ribbon with Trial/Plan + Stripe portal + seat meter.

Replace “Setup Progress” with the stateful post-install checklist (with live statuses and one-click actions).

Add a Digest status card with channel, schedule, and “Send sample now.”

Add Retention badge + link; add Export and Audit quick actions.

Show k= threshold inline on “Ready Threads” with an info tooltip + link to Trust.
