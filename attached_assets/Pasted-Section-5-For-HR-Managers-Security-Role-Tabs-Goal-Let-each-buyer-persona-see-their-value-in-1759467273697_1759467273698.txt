Section 5 — For HR · Managers · Security (Role Tabs)

Goal
Let each buyer persona see their value in ~10 seconds. Keep it compact, premium, and consistent with our system (seafoam as signal, quad cues, no big fills).

Framing (ship this)

H2: Built for your team

Subhead (one line): The same safe capture—tailored outcomes for HR, managers, and security.

Layout

Tabs row (desktop)

Three tabs: HR, Managers, Security.

Tabs are pills with underlines (no full fills).

Active tab uses a seafoam underline + tiny quad icon to the left of the label.

Visible teal focus ring on keyboard focus.

Panels

Exactly one panel visible at a time.

Panel width: max 980px, centered.

Panel structure:

Lead statement (1 sentence, ≤120 chars)

Proof module (one visual, not multiple cards)

Micro-list (3 bullets, one line each)

CTA link (small) to the most relevant deep page

Spacing

Top offset from Section 4: var(--space-L) = 72px

Section padding: pt-28 pb-36

Tabs → Panel: 16–20px

Inside panel: 16px gutters; 24px between elements

Panel content (copy + placeholders)
Tab 1 — HR

Lead: “Raise participation and retention—without risky open comments.”

Proof module: Aggregate Summary mini (condensed: header strip + two theme chips + small “You said → We did” chip).

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: AGG_SUMMARY_MINI

Micro-list:

Anonymous by default (themes, not names)

Clearer, behavior-focused input

Action loop builds trust

CTA link: See HR FAQ → (/faq#hr)

Shape cue: Seafoam header strip in the mini summary (signal = privacy).
Optional tomato: tiny dot inside the action icon only.

Tab 2 — Managers

Lead: “Fewer surprises, faster fixes—right in Slack.”

Proof module: Action Post card (“You said → We did”) with one concise action.

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: ACTION_POST_CARD

Micro-list:

Capture in Slack, < 60s from intent to submit

Themes in one place—no hunting in threads

Share outcomes in-channel

CTA link: See how it works → (#how-it-works)

Shape cue: Support Blue side rail (6–8px) on the left of the card.
No seafoam block fills.

Tab 3 — Security

Lead: “Privacy is enforced in the product—not promised in policy.”

Proof module: Security fact strip (mini)—the same three pills used earlier, condensed in a narrow rail.

Pills: Encrypt per org (AEAD) · Don’t log IPs in feedback tables · Isolate by tenant (RLS)

Placeholder: PLACEHOLDER: SECURITY_FACT_STRIP_MINI

Micro-list:

Per-org keys; tenant isolation (RLS)

No IPs/UA in feedback tables

SOC 2 audits + pen tests

CTA link: Read the details → (/trust#security)

Shape cue: Lilac corner lift backplate behind the mini rail (shadow only).

Color discipline

Seafoam only as underlines/chips/mini header strip—not full panels.

Support Blue (header/rail) and Lilac (corner backplate) used in small surfaces only; combined coverage ≤10% of viewport.

Tomato appears at most once inside whichever proof module is active.

Motion

Tab switch: Crossfade panel content (120–180ms) with a subtle slide (±4px).

Underline animates from center outward on active tab.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Mobile & Tablet

Tabs become a segmented control (scrollable on small screens, scrollbar hidden).

Panels stack vertically; proof module scales to full width.

Keep copy line lengths tight; truncate micro-list bullets if needed.

Accessibility

Tabs are proper tablist/tab semantics with keyboard navigation.

Active tab is announced to screen readers; panel content is linked via aria-controls.

Pill focus rings are teal and visible.

Contrast AA+ on all text over tints.
