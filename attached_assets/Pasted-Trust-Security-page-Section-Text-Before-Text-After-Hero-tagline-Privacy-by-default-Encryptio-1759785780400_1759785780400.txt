End-to-end encryption tile	“End-to-end encryption at rest with per-org 256-bit keys; plaintext never stored.”	“Ciphertext at rest with per-org 256-bit keys (XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD); message content never stored in plaintext.”
No PII in logs tile	“No PII in logs.”	“Content-free logs: no message text; tokens and identifiers redacted. Limited operational metadata only.”
Export safety tile	“Export safety – Requires k-anonymity; data stays safe.”	“Exports use k-safe views; no ciphertext; only summaries and metadata.”
Security controls — SRE monitoring	“SRE monitoring: 24×7 uptime monitoring and incident response processes.”	“Continuous monitoring and a documented incident-response program.” (Use this if coverage isn’t true 24×7 staffed)
Security controls — Retention	“30/90/365 or custom, legal hold freezes deletion.”	(Keep but add disclaimer) “30/90/365 or custom; Admin-controlled retention. Legal hold freezes deletion if required.”
K-anonymity section	“K-anonymity, enforced everywhere… No identities are stored or exposed.”	“K-anonymity enforced everywhere (default k=5). Small-n cohorts suppressed. Users should avoid self-identifying details in submissions.”

✅ Why this matters

Removes absolute statements that could create liability (“no PII,” “plaintext never stored”).

Avoids implying end-to-end encryption when it’s really per-org server-side encryption at rest.

Reframes SOC 2 / GDPR claims as support for compliance rather than certification.

Adds disclaimers about regulated data categories you don’t want to handle.
