Section 3 — “Why it’s safe” (Security Fact Strip)

Goal
Reassure HR/Security in 3 seconds without derailing the flow. It should feel premium and minimal—not a wall of badges.

Framing (ship this copy)

H2: Why it’s safe

Subhead (1 line): Privacy is enforced in the product—not promised in policy.

Layout

Single neutral rail with three inline pills (icon + verb-led fact).

No cards, no tiles, no big backgrounds.

Pills (exact text):

Encrypt per org (AEAD)

Don’t log IPs in feedback tables

Isolate by tenant (RLS)

Right-aligned small link: Read the details → (anchors to /trust#security)

Visual rules

Rail: neutral background (--card), subtle border (--border), rounded corners (--radius).

Pills: soft fill seafoam tint on hover only; default is outline.

Icons: deep-teal line icons, consistent stroke (≈1.75).

No seafoam blocks; seafoam acts as signal (outlines/hover only).

One tomato micro-dot max in this section (place inside the lock icon or not at all).

Spacing

Top offset from Section 2: var(--space-L) = 72px

Section padding: pt-16 pb-16 (desktop), pt-12 pb-12 (tablet), pt-10 pb-10 (mobile)

Rail internal padding: 16–20px vertical, 20–24px horizontal.

Motion

Pills fade/slide 2–3px on hover; no scale.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Accessibility

Text contrast AA on neutral rail and on seafoam hover.

Each pill is a button/link with a visible teal focus ring.

Link to /trust#security is keyboard reachable and clearly labeled (no “Learn more” ambiguity).

Mobile/Tablet

Pills become horizontal scroll (snap) on mobile.

Keep icons; truncate long labels with ellipsis if needed.

Acceptance checklist

Section has H2 + subhead + one rail with exactly 3 pills and a small right-aligned link.

No extra badges, timelines, or paragraphs.

Seafoam appears only as outline/hover—no big fills.

Icons consistent; stroke weight matches other sections.

Spacing matches tokens; the strip reads in <3 seconds.

If you need placeholders

Use icon placeholders (🔒, 🌐, 🧩) or your line icons—do not generate complex art.

Label the link target clearly: /trust#security.
