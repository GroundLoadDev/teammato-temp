PROMPT — Replace Section 3 (“Why it’s safe”) With a Clean Fact Strip

Objective: Rebuild Section 3 so it’s a single neutral rail with three inline pills and a right-aligned link. It must never show a scrollbar on desktop. Only on small screens may it horizontally scroll (with the scrollbar hidden).

Framing (keep exactly)

H2: Why it’s safe

Subhead: Privacy is enforced in the product—not promised in policy.

Layout (desktop & tablet: no scrollbars)

One full-width neutral rail (rounded, subtle border, soft shadow).

Inside the rail:

Left group: three pills in one row (gap: 12–16px, flex-wrap: wrap enabled).

Right: “Read the details →” link.

Rail internal padding: 16–20px vertical, 20–24px horizontal.

Pills (exact text; icon + label)

Encrypt per org (AEAD)

Don’t log IPs in feedback tables

Isolate by tenant (RLS)

Visual:

Default = outline pill (neutral border).

Hover = seafoam tint background, deep-teal text/icon.

Focus = teal focus ring (2px).

Icon stroke ~1.75, consistent.

Behavior rules

Desktop & tablet (≥768px):

overflow-x: visible on the rail.

Pills wrap to a second line if space is tight (no scrollbar, ever).

Keep the link right-aligned (space-between layout).

Mobile (<768px):

Rail becomes a horizontal scroll for the pills only.

Hide native scrollbar (scrollbar-width: none; -ms-overflow-style: none; and WebKit thumb hidden).

Ensure snap behavior (scroll-snap-type: x mandatory; scroll-snap-align: start on pills).

Spacing tokens (apply precisely)

Top offset from Section 2: 72px

Section padding: pt-16 pb-16 (desktop), pt-12 pb-12 (mobile)

H2 → Subhead: 8–12px

Subhead → Rail: 16–20px

Color discipline

Rail: --card bg with --border stroke; no seafoam fill.

Seafoam only appears on pill hover (signal).

One tomato micro-accent allowed inside the lock icon or omit entirely.

Motion (subtle)

Pill hover: fade + translate-y 1px (no scale).

Link hover: underline + slight color lift.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Accessibility

Pill text contrast AA on both neutral and seafoam hover.

All pills are links or buttons with visible focus rings.

The right link is keyboard-reachable after the pills.

Acceptance checklist (must pass)

No horizontal scrollbar on desktop/tablet, period.

Three pills visible in one row on wide screens; they wrap if space is tight.

On mobile, pills scroll horizontally with hidden scrollbar and snap.

Icons consistent; stroke ≈1.75; teal focus rings show.

Seafoam used only on hover; rail stays neutral.
