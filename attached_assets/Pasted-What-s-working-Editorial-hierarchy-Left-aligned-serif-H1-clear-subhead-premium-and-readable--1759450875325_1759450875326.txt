What’s working

Editorial hierarchy: Left-aligned serif H1 + clear subhead = premium and readable.

Quad motif: Visible in hero, bento, and accent banner—nice brand signature.

Seafoam accent: Much better than the yellow/brown. Feels trustworthy.

Signature modules: Aggregate Summary, Anonymity Promise, Security Fact Bar—distinct and on-story.

Asymmetry: The bento trio breaks the grid monotony.

What to improve (high-impact first)
1) Focus the hero on product proof

Issue: The hero still feels like a typography spec.
Fix: Swap “Type Scale & Hierarchy” for a single real product scene: headline, 1-sentence subcopy, and a convincing modal crop that overlaps the section edge (break the card). Keep the type scale demo lower on the page.

Copy tweak:
Subhead: “Anonymous by default. Behavior-focused by design. Built for action.” (shorter, stronger)

2) Make the quad motif bolder but rarer

Issue: Small, washed-out quads risk reading as decoration.
Fix: Choose two moments to go bold (hero watermark + aggregate header), and tone down elsewhere (e.g., remove from bento backgrounds). Increase opacity slightly in hero (6–8%), lower or remove in others for contrast hierarchy.

3) Elevate the “Aggregate Summary” card

Issue: It’s good, but it can become the signature shot.
Fixes:

Add a thin teal outline to the header strip; use mini quads/dots as cohort indicators (3–5).

Include a tiny “released on [Week ##]” chip to hint at k-safe batching.

Give the “You said → We did” chip a subtle success tint (seafoam border) so it reads as an action tag, not a badge.

4) Tighten the “Security Fact Bar”

Issue: Icons are a bit generic; copy is passive.
Fix: Use verb-led facts and fewer words. Examples:

“Encrypt per organization (AEAD)”

“Don’t log IPs in feedback tables”

“Isolate by tenant (RLS)”
Optional: add a tiny “Learn more” chevron that jumps to /trust anchors.

5) Buttons and states = brand feel

Issue: Primary feels flat; ghost lacks intent.
Fix:

Add micro-press on click (shadow → translate-y 1px).

Ghost should show intent on hover (seafoam tint, not gray).

Keep teal focus rings very visible everywhere (accessibility signal).

6) Inputs: push the SBI story

Issue: Inputs demonstrate components, not the Teammato POV.
Fix: Use the final microcopy we wrote (observable actions, effects) and add a single inline anti-pattern hint state (“Remove names/@—describe the behavior instead”) to show your guardrails.

7) Accent usage guidelines

Issue: Seafoam sometimes fills big blocks that read samey.
Fix: Reserve seafoam for signals (promise banner, active tabs, hints). Prefer neutral card for content sections; use seafoam strips, tags, and borders instead of full cards when possible.

8) Visual rhythm and spacing

Issue: Sections have similar height; scroll feels uniform.
Fix: Alternate tall/short sections. Example: hero (tall), summary (medium), promise (short, full-bleed), fact bar (compact), bento (tall).

9) Tomato brand touches (micro, not macro)

Issue: Brand red is almost invisible now.
Fix: Use tomato red for tiny accents only: divider dot in the headline, notification dot on the modal crop, or the “Action taken” icon. Never use as a background.

10) Real-world copy & data density

Issue: Some lorem-ish phrases reduce believability.
Fix: Replace at least two spots with realistic examples (e.g., “Add QA sign-off” → “Add QA sign-off to Friday release checklist”). Denser, specific bullets make screenshots feel true.

Quick punch-list for the next pass (no code here—just directions)

Hero

Remove “Type Scale & Hierarchy” framing; keep headline + subhead.

Increase quad watermark scale + opacity slightly (6–8%), position off-edge.

Modal crop overlaps section edge; add micro shadow and 1px teal outline.

Aggregate Summary

Header: seafoam strip with 3–4 cohort dots, thin teal underline.

Add “Released Week W41” chip.

“You said → We did” chip: subtle seafoam border.

Anonymity Promise

Keep full-width seafoam; add a small lock-quad icon on the left.

One sentence only.

Security Fact Bar

Replace copy with verb-led facts; add “Learn more →” link to /trust anchors.

Bento trio

Remove background quads; keep one bigger, blurred quad behind the center card only.

Use verbs for titles (“Capture in Slack,” “Protect anonymity,” “Publish actions”).

Buttons & Inputs

Demonstrate hover/active/focus side-by-side.

Inputs: final SBI placeholders + one example of the “no @mentions” validation hint.

Cards

Replace one accent card with a neutral card + seafoam side strip (less blocky).

Add one quad-corner card (lift one corner subtly).

Spacing & rhythm

Vary section vertical padding (hero 96px, summary 64px, promise 40px, fact bar 32px, bento 80px).

Tomato micro-accents

Add a single tomato-red 4px dot in the H1 (between em-dash and “in Slack,” or as a lead-in bullet).

Use tomato for the tiny “Action taken” icon only.

Footer

Replace “Design Gallery” line with: “Reading live theme tokens • Light mode • Quad system v1”.
